# Minecraft-Bugfixes

I will throw some decompiled Minecraft-classes with bugfixes into this repository from time to time to link it on the Minecraft Bug Tracker (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC).

It will only contain single (or just even partial) classes and it is not intended to pirate anything, but just to help explain bugs and possible fixes.
